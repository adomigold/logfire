## Adding New Log Format Support

Logfire currently supports Apache and Nginx access logs. To add support for a new log format:

1. **Fork the repository and create a new branch.**

2. **Implement a parser for the new log format:**

   - Add a new function in `parser.c` (e.g., `parseMyFormatLogLine`) that takes a raw log line and extracts fields into the `LogEntry` structure.
   - Handle parsing errors gracefully.
   - Add tests for your parser if possible.

3. **Integrate the new parser:**

   - Modify `parseLogFile` in `parser.c` or create a dispatch mechanism to detect and delegate parsing based on the log format or user input.
   - Update CLI options if needed to allow users to specify the log format.

4. **Update documentation:**

   - Add details about the new format to `README.md` under supported log types.
   - Update examples if applicable.

5. **Test thoroughly:**

   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions.
   - Add new tests covering edge cases for the new format.

6. **Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.**
